let adamsArray = [];

/*
The array above currently has nothing it it. It's totally empty.
Your task is to write some lines of code to fill this array with the numbers 0 through 9

HINT  -  You can use "adamsArray.push()" to add something to the array.
         For example:
            adamsArray.push(4); // This adds the number 4 to the end of the array

BONUS CHALLENGE - Can you use a "for-loop" in your solution? Google "Javascript for loop".
